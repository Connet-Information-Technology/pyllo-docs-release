Pyllo Platform Overview
=======================
The Pyllo platform follows a layered structure, reminiscent of a logo, with each layer serving a specific purpose in 
the overall architecture. At the foundation lies the Pyllo Runtime, which acts as a small runtime engine responsible 
for integrating different plugins seamlessly. It not only provides the necessary infrastructure for plugin integration 
but also defines the features and rules (API) that plugins must adhere to.

Building on top of the Pyllo Runtime is the Pyllo UI library, which utilizes the QT framework to implement a wide range 
of UI components and plugin UI functionalities. This layer ensures a cohesive and consistent user interface experience 
throughout the platform, making it intuitive and user-friendly.

The core of the Pyllo platform resides within the plugins themselves. These plugins, created internally, form the 
building blocks of the platform's functionality. Pyllo strives to achieve seamless integration of various tools and a 
controlled openness by establishing a common paradigm for quickly creating plugins and reusing existing toolkits. By 
leveraging this extensibility, users can shape Pyllo to meet their specific needs or simply for the sake of 
experimentation and fun.
